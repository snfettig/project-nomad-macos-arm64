Project N.O.M.A.D. is a self-contained, offline-first knowledge and education server packed with critical tools, knowledge, and AI to keep you informed and empowered—anytime, anywhere.

## Installation & Quickstart (macOS)

This fork is designed for macOS with Apple Silicon. Prerequisites: [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) installed natively for Metal GPU acceleration.

#### Quick Install
```bash
# Install dependencies
brew install --cask docker
brew install ollama gh

# Clone this repo
gh repo clone snfettig/project-nomad-macos-arm64
cd project-nomad-macos-arm64

# Start Ollama (if not already running)
ollama serve &

# Run the macOS install script
bash install/install_nomad_macos.sh
```

Project N.O.M.A.D. is now installed on your Mac! Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to start exploring!

#### Linux Install (upstream)
For Debian/Ubuntu on x86_64, see the [upstream project](https://github.com/Crosstalk-Solutions/project-nomad) for the original install instructions.

## How It Works
N.O.M.A.D. is a management UI ("Command Center") and API that orchestrates a collection of containerized tools and resources via [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). It handles installation, configuration, and updates for everything — so you don't have to.

**Built-in capabilities include:**
- **AI Chat with Knowledge Base** — local AI chat powered by [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), with document upload and semantic search (RAG via [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/))
- **Information Library** — offline Wikipedia, medical references, ebooks, and more via [Kiwix](https://kiwix.org/)
- **Education Platform** — Khan Academy courses with progress tracking via [Kolibri](https://learningequality.org/kolibri/)
- **Offline Maps** — downloadable regional maps via [ProtoMaps](https://protomaps.com)
- **Data Tools** — encryption, encoding, and analysis via [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)
- **Notes** — local note-taking via [FlatNotes](https://github.com/dullage/flatnotes)
- **System Benchmark** — hardware scoring with a [community leaderboard](https://benchmark.projectnomad.us)
- **Easy Setup Wizard** — guided first-time configuration with curated content collections

N.O.M.A.D. also includes built-in tools like a Wikipedia content selector, ZIM library manager, and content explorer.

## Device Requirements

> **This fork** was created to run Project N.O.M.A.D. on **macOS / Apple Silicon (arm64)** with native **Metal GPU acceleration** via Ollama. The upstream project targets Debian/Ubuntu on x86_64 with NVIDIA GPUs. This fork adds macOS-specific install scripts, multi-arch Docker image builds, and native Ollama integration so that Apple Silicon Macs can use their Metal GPU for local AI inference instead of running Ollama inside Docker (which has no GPU passthrough on macOS).

At its core, N.O.M.A.D. is still very lightweight. For a barebones installation of the management application itself, the following minimal specs are required:

#### Minimum Specs
- Processor: Apple M1 or later
- RAM: 8 GB unified memory
- Storage: At least 5 GB free disk space
- OS: macOS 15 (Sequoia) or later
- Stable internet connection (required during install only)

To run LLMs and other included AI tools:

#### Optimal Specs
- A newer Apple Mac with Apple Silicon (M2 Pro / M3 Pro / M4 or better)
- RAM: 32 GB unified memory or more (Apple Silicon shares memory between CPU and GPU — more RAM = larger AI models)
- Storage: At least 250 GB free disk space (SSD standard on all Macs)
- OS: macOS 26 or later
- Stable internet connection (required during install only)

*Tested on a MacBook Pro with M4 Max.*

For the original upstream hardware recommendations (Linux/NVIDIA), see the [Hardware Guide](https://www.projectnomad.us/hardware).

## About Internet Usage & Privacy
Project N.O.M.A.D. is designed for offline usage. An internet connection is only required during the initial installation (to download dependencies) and if you (the user) decide to download additional tools and resources at a later time. Otherwise, N.O.M.A.D. does not require an internet connection and has ZERO built-in telemetry.

To test internet connectivity, N.O.M.A.D. attempts to make a request to Cloudflare's utility endpoint, `https://1.1.1.1/cdn-cgi/trace` and checks for a successful response.

## About Security
By design, Project N.O.M.A.D. is intended to be open and available without hurdles - it includes no authentication. If you decide to connect your device to a local network after install (e.g. for allowing other devices to access it's resources), you can block/open ports to control which services are exposed.

**Will authentication be added in the future?** Maybe. It's not currently a priority, but if there's enough demand for it, we may consider building in an optional authentication layer in a future release to support uses cases where multiple users need access to the same instance but with different permission levels (e.g. family use with parental controls, classroom use with teacher/admin accounts, etc.). For now, we recommend using network-level controls to manage access if you're planning to expose your N.O.M.A.D. instance to other devices on a local network. N.O.M.A.D. is not designed to be exposed directly to the internet, and we strongly advise against doing so unless you really know what you're doing, have taken appropriate security measures, and understand the risks involved.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome and appreciated! Please read this section fully to understand how to contribute to the project.

### General Guidelines

- **Open an issue first**: Before starting work on a new feature or bug fix, please open an issue to discuss your proposed changes. This helps ensure that your contribution aligns with the project's goals and avoids duplicate work. Title the issue clearly and provide a detailed description of the problem or feature you want to work on.
- **Fork the repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page to create a copy of the project under your GitHub account.
- **Create a new branch**: In your forked repository, create a new branch for your work. Use a descriptive name for the branch that reflects the purpose of your changes (e.g., `fix/issue-123` or `feature/add-new-tool`).
- **Make your changes**: Implement your changes in the new branch. Follow the existing code style and conventions used in the project. Be sure to test your changes locally to ensure they work as expected.
- **Add Release Notes**: If your changes include new features, bug fixes, or improvements, please see the "Release Notes" section below to properly document your contribution for the next release.
- **Conventional Commits**: When committing your changes, please use conventional commit messages to provide clear and consistent commit history. The format is `<type>(<scope>): <description>`, where:
  - `type` is the type of change (e.g., `feat` for new features, `fix` for bug fixes, `docs` for documentation changes, etc.)
  - `scope` is an optional area of the codebase that your change affects (e.g., `api`, `ui`, `docs`, etc.)
  - `description` is a brief summary of the change
- **Submit a pull request**: Once your changes are ready, submit a pull request to the main repository. Provide a clear description of your changes and reference any related issues. The project maintainers will review your pull request and may provide feedback or request changes before it can be merged.
- **Be responsive to feedback**: If the maintainers request changes or provide feedback on your pull request, please respond in a timely manner. Stale pull requests may be closed if there is no activity for an extended period.
- **Follow the project's code of conduct**: Please adhere to the project's code of conduct when interacting with maintainers and other contributors. Be respectful and considerate in your communications.
- **No guarantee of acceptance**: The project is community-driven, and all contributions are appreciated, but acceptance is not guaranteed. The maintainers will evaluate each contribution based on its quality, relevance, and alignment with the project's goals.
- **Thank you for contributing to Project N.O.M.A.D.!** Your efforts help make this project better for everyone.

### Versioning
This project uses semantic versioning. The version is managed in the root `package.json` 
and automatically updated by semantic-release. For simplicity's sake, the "project-nomad" image
uses the same version defined there instead of the version in `admin/package.json` (stays at 0.0.0), as it's the only published image derived from the code.

### Release Notes
Human-readable release notes live in [`admin/docs/release-notes.md`](admin/docs/release-notes.md) and are displayed in the Command Center's built-in documentation.

When working on changes, add a summary to the `## Unreleased` section at the top of that file under the appropriate heading:

- **Features** — new user-facing capabilities
- **Bug Fixes** — corrections to existing behavior
- **Improvements** — enhancements, refactors, docs, or dependency updates

Use the format `- **Area**: Description` to stay consistent with existing entries. When a release is triggered, CI automatically stamps the version and date, commits the update, and pushes the content to the GitHub release.
